## Description

> Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information at any time is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to the success of an application that handles usersâ€™ financial information.I've updated an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online. The app was then deployed to Heroku.

## Instruction

Then you will have to ensure that node package manager(NPM) has been installed (using "npm install" in the terminal) so that you can install all of the dependencies needed for the app (Listed in the package.json file). The application can be deployed through hosting sites such as heroku and can utilize MongoDB Atlas in order to support the cloud database.
